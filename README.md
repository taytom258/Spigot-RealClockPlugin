Unless otherwise stated, all source code is open source licensed under both GNU GPLv3 & LGPLv3. Since it is open source, I have no problem with people modifying files and doing as they see fit, however if you use my unmodified jar please reference the GitHub repository or this post for credit due. If you do modify the files and repackage them, do not include myself or the name of this plugin to avoid confusion. This is all that I ask when it comes to redistribution and repackaging.
